# Sentiment-Analysis-Bot
A beginner-friendly sentiment analysis bot for Twitter data using TextBlob and VADER.
The Sentiment Analysis Bot is a beginner-friendly Python project that analyzes text from Twitter (X posts) to determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. It uses two tools—TextBlob and VADER—to guess the emotion in tweets, like whether someone is happy, sad, or neutral about a topic. You’ll clean the messy tweet text (e.g., remove links and hashtags), analyze it, and then show the results with a pretty chart. This project teaches you about Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is how computers understand human words, and it’s useful for things like checking customer opinions online.

**Why It’s Cool**

You’ll see how computers “feel” emotions in text.
It’s a real-world skill companies use to understand feedback.
You get to play with code, data, and charts—all in a weekend!

**Tools You’ll Use**

Python: The programming language.
Pandas: To handle the tweet data like a spreadsheet.
TextBlob: A simple tool to guess sentiment.
VADER (via NLTK): A smarter tool for social media text.
Matplotlib: To draw a bar chart of results.
Dataset: A CSV file with tweets (e.g., twitter_validation.csv from Kaggle).

**Flowchart**
Start: Begin the project.
Load Data: Read the tweet CSV file.
Clean Text: Remove junk like URLs and hashtags from tweets.
Analyze Sentiment: Use TextBlob or VADER to label each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral.
Count Results: Add up how many tweets are positive, negative, or neutral.
Show Chart: Draw a bar chart to see the results.
End: Finish and admire your work!


**Algorithm**

An algorithm is like a recipe—it’s the instructions your computer follows. Here’s a beginner-friendly version for the Sentiment Analysis Bot:

Steps in Plain English

Get the Ingredients: Load the tweet data from a CSV file into a table (using Pandas).
Wash the Veggies: Clean each tweet by removing URLs, @mentions, hashtags, punctuation, and making it all lowercase.
Cook with TextBlob:
For each tweet, ask TextBlob: “Is this happy (+), sad (-), or meh (0)?”
If the score is above 0, call it “positive.” Below 0, “negative.” Exactly 0, “neutral.”
Cook with VADER:
For each tweet, ask VADER: “What’s the overall vibe?”
If the score is above 0, call it “positive.” Below 0, “negative.” Exactly 0, “neutral.”
Count the Dishes: Count how many tweets are positive, negative, and neutral.
Serve it Pretty: Make a bar chart with Matplotlib to show the counts.
Taste Test: Print the counts and show the chart.


**Pseudo Code**
BEGIN
  1. Load file "twitter_validation.csv" into a table called "df"
  2. FOR each tweet in df["text"]:
       Clean tweet: remove "http://...", "@user", "#hashtag", punctuation, make lowercase
       Save cleaned tweet in df["clean_text"]
  3. FOR each cleaned tweet:
       TextBlob score = get polarity (number from -1 to 1)
       IF score > 0 THEN sentiment = "positive"
       ELSE IF score < 0 THEN sentiment = "negative"
       ELSE sentiment = "neutral"
       Save in df["sentiment_textblob"]
  4. FOR each cleaned tweet:
       VADER score = get compound score (number from -1 to 1)
       IF score > 0 THEN sentiment = "positive"
       ELSE IF score < 0 THEN sentiment = "negative"
       ELSE sentiment = "neutral"
       Save in df["sentiment_vader"]
  5. Count how many "positive", "negative", "neutral" in df["sentiment_vader"]
  6. Print the counts
  7. Draw a bar chart of the counts
END
